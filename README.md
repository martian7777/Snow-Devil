# Snow Devil

Snow Devil is a local-first Windows desktop application for understanding how work moves through GitHub. It brings current responsibilities, historical account and repository state, delivery analytics, source browsing, pull-request diffs, notifications, and inspectable evidence into one persistent Tauri workspace.

The product is intentionally evidence-aware: incomplete GitHub data is labeled partial, inferred, stale, unsupported, or unavailable instead of being presented as exact.

## Product status

- Version: `0.1.0`
- Primary platform: Windows desktop through Tauri 2 and WebView2
- GitHub behavior: read-only native integration
- Modes: authenticated GitHub account and deterministic offline Demo Mode
- Persistence: local SQLite, operating-system credential storage, and selected local preferences
- Current verification baseline: 289 frontend tests, 27 Playwright tests, and 60 Rust tests passing

## What Snow Devil helps answer

- What needs my attention right now?
- Which issues, pull requests, reviews, checks, branches, or repositories are blocked or aging?
- What was active or completed on a particular date?
- How did work progress through review, checks, merge, release, and deployment?
- How healthy is delivery flow across my maintained repositories?
- What source file, patch, or evidence record explains a signal?
- Which facts are exact, partial, inferred, stale, or unavailable?

## Implemented features

### Desktop workspace

- Persistent native and embedded-GitHub tabs with restored-state migration and sanitization.
- Home, Flow, CI Health, Inventory, Flow Analytics, Personal Focus, Account History, Repository History, Settings, Notifications, Evidence Graph, Repository Explorer, and Pull Request Diff surfaces.
- Tab context menus, refresh behavior, keyboard navigation, middle-click close, pinned tabs, and safe fallback to Home.
- Shell-level render recovery so malformed restored state produces a recovery screen instead of a blank window.
- One canonical Snow Devil dark visual system with responsive desktop layouts, reduced-motion support, visible focus states, and semantic status colors.

### Home and current Flow

- Home command center with attention totals, active/completed work, pipeline preview, recent repositories, recent merges, synchronization context, and deep links.
- Account and repository Flow scopes with lifecycle stages for issues, coding, pull requests, review, checks, ready, merged, released, and deployed work.
- Repository, range, stage, view, involvement, actor, activity, and structured-search filters.
- Viewer-relationship labels such as authored, assigned, review requested, and submitted upstream.
- Organization-aware repository discovery and base-repository handling for incoming fork pull requests.
- Saved local views for reusable Flow and analytics filters.
- Event Stream and supporting totals with inspectable evidence.

#### Focused-stage scrolling

Home deep links into a single Flow stage now use a bounded, dedicated vertical scroll owner rather than the multi-stage horizontal board model.

- Mouse wheel, trackpad, Page Up, Page Down, Home, End, and focus scrolling work.
- All loaded cards and the final row remain reachable.
- The responsive grid expands from one to four columns as space permits.
- Show more and Load more append without jumping to the top.
- Inspector resize and tab switching preserve normalized scroll position and expansion state.
- The Event Stream/footer reserves its own space and does not cover cards.
- Multi-stage Flow retains its horizontal lane behavior.

### Account History and Repository History

The former simulators are now date-first cumulative history explorers:

> Choose a date and see what existed, what was active, what was completed, and how far the account or repository had progressed.

- Strict selected-date cutoff with no future-state leakage.
- Canonical entity identity and deterministic event ordering.
- Semantic duplicate suppression before reconstruction and counting.
- Baseline support for work that existed before the loaded range, labeled **Existing at history start**.
- Authoritative current-state assertions only at Today/latest; they never rewrite an older date.
- Separate **Active on selected date**, **Completed by selected date**, and compact activity sections.
- Date picker, previous/next meaningful date, Today, optional animation, filters, search, and incremental pagination.
- Responsive playback controls never overlap; hiding them pauses playback without resetting the selected date.
- One business-timezone cutoff drives the picker, slider, tooltip, Today state, activity, metrics, and inspector evidence.
- Cumulative metrics for PRs, issues, reviews, repositories, contributors, releases, deployments, and recorded evidence.
- Repository History includes loaded work targeting the selected base repository regardless of author or fork origin.
- Truthful aggregate source states such as `History ready · Partial data · N of M sources loaded`.
- Source Details includes purpose, affected data, status, reason, and retryability when supplied by the provider.
- Source Details is a keyboard-accessible, tab-scoped disclosure with a close action and bounded internal scrolling.
- Source completeness and historical depth are reported separately, and refresh retains the previous snapshot.
- Persisted tabs using the old Simulator names reopen under the new History labels without changing internal route IDs.
- Fixed native pages use singleton identities and restore mounted state instead of refetching merely because the tab was activated.

### Analytics and evidence

- CI Health with branch age, integration activity, health grades, percentiles, and inspectable lineage.
- Delivery Inventory with unique work-item aggregation, age bands, blocked/failing/review views, and search/sort controls.
- Flow Analytics with cumulative flow, throughput, lead-time distributions, review wait, check timing, percentiles, outlier handling, and source coverage.
- Personal Focus with reviews requested, authored work, failed checks, WIP, aging/dormant work, and local dismiss/snooze/exclusion preferences.
- Metric lineage in the Inspector, including formula, sample count, time basis, included repositories, exclusions, and confidence.
- Evidence Graph for bounded native traversal of related work and evidence.

#### Responsive Cumulative Flow chart

- The plot measures its actual container with `ResizeObserver`.
- SVG width, viewBox, x-scale, hit areas, grid, crosshair, and tooltip bounds update together.
- It responds to live window resizing, inspector open/close, font readiness, and parent layout changes.
- The plotting region uses the full panel width with no fixed desktop maximum.
- Height remains stable while width changes.
- Legend, axes, selected date, keyboard interaction, and reduced-motion behavior are preserved.

### Repository investigation

- Lazy hierarchical repository tree with branch selection, file/folder icons, loaded-entry filtering, keyboard navigation, breadcrumbs, and persistent expansion state.
- A dedicated tree scroll region so expanded folders do not hide lower files.
- Stale-request protection when changing repositories, branches, folders, or files quickly.
- Breadcrumb state based on the selected path rather than stale content data, preventing the previous repository-specific render failure.
- Text preview with line numbers and in-file search.
- Rendered GitHub-flavored Markdown.
- Safe PNG, JPEG, SVG, and WebP preview with dimensions, Fit, Actual Size, zoom, reset, sanitization, and object-URL cleanup.
- Large-file guards: normal text rendering stops above 1 MB and in-app image decoding stops above 5 MB.
- Native pull-request diff with changed-file navigation, additions/deletions, unified/split layouts, filters, and canonical GitHub fallback.
- Repository search and virtualized tree support for larger source sets.

### GitHub and account integration

- GitHub OAuth device flow configured from the sign-in dialog.
- GraphQL and REST adapters for account, repository, workflow, simulator, analytics, notification, and source evidence.
- Token storage in the operating-system credential store.
- Local normalized cache with refresh, stale, partial, failed-source, reset, and recovery states.
- Managed embedded GitHub webviews with restricted navigation and native tab identity.
- Native read-only notification inbox with unread state, search, reason filters, local snooze, native PR routing, and GitHub links.
- Global command palette for commands, repositories, files, issues, pull requests, and cached entities.
- Privacy-safe diagnostic export containing runtime metadata and anonymous record counts—never tokens, cookies, repository names, API payloads, or file contents.
- Explicit restrictive Content Security Policy in the Tauri configuration.

### Demo Mode

- Runs from deterministic source-controlled fixtures without requiring a GitHub account.
- Does not silently fall back to live GitHub traffic.
- Uses the same production data types and primary interfaces.
- Supports reset and exit without writing demo records into live account caches.

## Historical correctness model

For a selected date, Snow Devil:

1. excludes evidence after the cutoff;
2. sorts eligible evidence deterministically;
3. deduplicates semantically equivalent records;
4. applies a baseline when an entity predates the loaded range;
5. reconstructs the strongest supported state;
6. separates active and completed canonical entities; and
7. calculates cumulative metrics from the same retained evidence.

Current assertions are supplemental and only apply at Today/latest. Missing transitions are not invented. Event count may exceed entity count because one entity can have several lifecycle records.

## Architecture

| Layer | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2 |
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite |
| Client state | Zustand with persisted workspace preferences |
| Server state | TanStack Query |
| Native backend | Rust Tauri commands |
| GitHub access | OAuth device flow, GraphQL, and REST |
| Local persistence | SQLite plus selected browser/local preferences |
| Credentials | Operating-system credential store |
| Embedded web | Managed Tauri child webviews for GitHub |
| Tests | Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright, and Rust tests |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- A recent Node.js release
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Stable Rust toolchain
- Tauri 2 Windows prerequisites, including WebView2 and the Microsoft C++ build tools
- Optional: a GitHub OAuth App client ID with Device Flow enabled for authenticated mode

### Install

```powershell
pnpm install
```

### Run the desktop app

```powershell
pnpm tauri dev
```

Choose Demo Mode for deterministic offline evaluation, or connect GitHub and enter the OAuth client ID when prompted.

### Run the browser-only frontend

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

The browser-only Vite build is useful for frontend development and automated tests, but it cannot reproduce Tauri commands, credential storage, SQLite, native window behavior, or embedded child webviews.

## Development commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Vite frontend |
| `pnpm tauri dev` | Start the complete desktop app |
| `pnpm build` | Type-check and build the frontend |
| `pnpm test` | Run frontend unit/integration tests |
| `pnpm test:watch` | Run Vitest in watch mode |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run Playwright end-to-end tests |
| `pnpm lint` | Run ESLint over TypeScript/React source |
| `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` | Run Rust tests |

## Continuous Integration

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run four required checks: **Frontend Quality**, **Rust Quality**, **Playwright E2E**, and **Windows Tauri Build**. CI has read-only repository permission and never creates or publishes a release.

## Releases

A matching semantic-version tag such as `v0.1.0` builds one draft release with Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS Apple Silicon, and macOS Intel assets. The tag must match the versions in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`. Apple Silicon and Intel are separate architecture-verified DMGs.

Release builds are unsigned and are not notarized. Windows may show an unrecognized-publisher warning, and macOS users may need to approve Snow Devil in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. Only the release workflow's final publication job receives write permission.

### Installing an unsigned build

Snow Devil ships without paid OS code-signing certificates, so each platform shows a one-time warning you can safely clear:

- **Windows** — If SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC"*, click **More info → Run anyway**. Installing through a package manager (Scoop or winget) also avoids the prompt.
- **macOS** — If Gatekeeper says the app *"cannot be opened"* or *"is damaged"*, right-click (or Control-click) **Snow Devil.app → Open → Open**. If it still refuses, clear the download quarantine flag in Terminal:

  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Snow Devil.app"
  ```

- **Linux** — For the AppImage, make it executable first:

  ```bash
  chmod +x Snow-Devil_*.AppImage && ./Snow-Devil_*.AppImage
  ```

  For the `.deb`, install with `sudo dpkg -i Snow-Devil_*.deb`.

In-app updates are still cryptographically verified with the project's own signing key even though the installers themselves are unsigned, so an update cannot be silently tampered with.

## Latest verification

The History controls, loading truthfulness, and persistent-tab final patch was verified with:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend production build | Pass |
| Frontend unit/integration | 65 files, 306 tests passed |
| Playwright | 29 tests passed |
| Rust | 60 tests passed |
| ESLint | 0 errors; 42 advisory warnings |
| Diff whitespace check | Pass |
| Native Tauri layouts | Verified at 1280×720, 1600×900, and 1920×1080 |

Native checks covered History playback and Source Details at all target widths, Escape/focus restoration, inspector compression, fixed-page reactivation, refresh-with-snapshot, Reduced Motion stepping, Asia/Karachi cutoff agreement, focused Flow scrolling, and responsive Cumulative Flow sizing.

## Current limitations

- Snow Devil's native GitHub integration is read-only. It does not merge PRs, submit reviews, post comments, edit issues, rerun workflows, or trigger releases/deployments.
- GitHub permissions, pagination, retention, API support, and organization authorization determine available evidence.
- History cannot reconstruct events GitHub did not expose; incomplete sources remain partial.
- Repository tree filtering is not a replacement for complete GitHub code search.
- Very large expanded trees and extremely large history result sets may still benefit from additional virtualization.
- Native diff focuses on textual patches and does not provide GitHub's complete review workflow.
- Business-time calculations do not currently include public holidays.
- The primary supported experience is the packaged Windows application. A signature-verified in-app updater is implemented; OS code signing/notarization is intentionally omitted (see **Installing an unsigned build**), and broad clean-machine qualification remains follow-up work.
- Team workspaces, shared dashboards, cloud synchronization, role-based access, and multi-account operation are not implemented.

## Design principle

Snow Devil is not a replacement for GitHub. It is a calm, local, evidence-aware workspace for understanding GitHub work—and for knowing when the available evidence is not complete enough to support a stronger claim.
